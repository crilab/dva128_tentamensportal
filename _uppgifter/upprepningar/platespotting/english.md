Platespotting is a game where you start by looking for a car whose license plate number ends with 001. Then, you look for a car whose license plate number ends with 002. After that, you look for 003, and so you continue until you have counted to 999:

- ABC001
- RND002
- ...
- XYZ998
- ZZZ999

When you have counted to 999, the game is considered finished.

Construct a program that helps a user play Platespotting. While the program is running, the user inputs the license plates of passing cars. The program should keep track of when the user, according to Platespotting rules, has counted to 999. Then, a string should be printed that informs the user that the game is over, after which the program terminates.

A suggested solution is shown below:

Construct a game where a user (player) has to guess an integer between 0 and 99. The correct integer should be generated by a random number generator when the game starts and kept hidden from the player.

Each time the user guesses incorrectly, the program should indicate whether the actual number is higher or lower than their most recent guess.

If the user guesses correctly, the program should print the number of guesses and then terminate.

In case of invalid input, display an error message and let the user try again.

A sample solution is shown below:
